My first Angular project.

It does a real time multiplication with the numbers present on the two fields at the screen.
The result shows on the H3 tag right below the fields

If necessary, is possible to see the multiplication historic by clicking on the button "Mostrar hist√≥rico"

Wheter one of the fields is zero/null, the multiplication won't be excecuted. In this case, the historic will not be filled
